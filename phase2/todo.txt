J Chan::
- model completion: menuBM2, menuU3, menuBM4
    - menuBM2 takes usernames instead of listing all users
    - extra backs and/or exits for each input ?
+ You could create a GUI with Java's swing package (JFrames, JPanels, etc.),
with XML (there are Java XML tutorials online), make a more robust and
feature-rich command line interface, or other sort of UI.
    - swing: GUI form
    - OR javaFX ? (newer, more optimized) - but less guides on it and stuff
